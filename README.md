# SparseSolv
SparseMatrix and Matrix Solvers including the shifted-ICCG

## SparseSolv
Provide sparse matrix and its linear solver.

## SparseSolvPy
Python binding of the SparseSolv Using Pybind11

## examples
example:
### Pybind_example.py
A simple sample using python
### Voxel FEM
A simple C++ sample based on voxel elements.
This method uses A-formula withough coulomb gauge and regularization terms.
Original A-fomula is solved by shifted-ICCG.
(Voxel mesh is now preparing...)
